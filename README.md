## OvS-DPDK with TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) feature
This repository consists of the patched version of OvS to enable TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) feature. Moreover, [wiki](https://github.com/harshgondaliya/ovs-dpdk-with-tso/wiki) of this repository provides a step by step guide: to set up OvS-DPDK bridge, configure VM using libvirt and connect VMs to an OvS-DPDK bridge. In addition, the wiki provides bandwidth and latency results that were obtained while using OvS-DPDK and while using OvS.

**Note (as per the status quo in May 2019)**: As communicated in a [thread](https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-discuss/2019-May/048671.html) at OvS mailing list, _TSO is not supported currently in OvS-DPDK. TSO essentially requires the 
enablement of multi segment mbuf in OVS as well as TSO enablement. There were patches proposed previously to enable both of these but they have not made it upstream to date due to concerns around their impact for non TSO usecases as well as some of the fundamental changes introduced with respect to the mbuf itself._

The repository provides an already patched version of OvS code. [Patch 1](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openvswitch/list/?series=85802&state=*) & [Patch 2](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openvswitch/list/?series=85807&state=*) were applied on top of [adb3f0b ("python: Avoid flake8 warning for unused variables.")](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/commits?author=blp&since=2019-01-01&until=2019-01-23) commit to add Support for mbuf and TSO respectively. Further, [DPDK stable version 18.11.2](https://core.dpdk.org/download/) is used to have the user-space datapath.  

**Credit:** Ian Stokes (Intel) through his [reply at mailing list](https://mail.openvswitch.org/pipermail/ovs-discuss/2019-May/048671.html) has provided perfect pointers to patches, cover letters and documentation to enable TSO feature for OvS-DPDK. This repository is just providing patched version of code and the wiki is intended to help new users get started quickly with experimenting Inter-VM communication using OvS-DPDK.
